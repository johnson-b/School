THE SORTING METHODS THAT ARE PRESENT IN PROJECT 3 WORK FINE. HOWEVER, THE WAY PIXELS ARE GETTING HANDLED IN EACH VECTOR TO DO THE ACTUAL MEDIAN FILTERING DOES NOT. LET'S JUST SAY, IT PUTS A FUN TWIST ON THE ORIGINAL IMAGE. THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF FILTERING DOES TAKE PLACE AND THE IMAGE IS STILL READABLE BUT IT SEEMS TO HAVE SOMEWHAT OF A SLANT.

!!!IMPORTANT!!!
MY PROGRAM **REQUIRES** C++11 TO RUN, IF RAN WITH -std=c++11 EVERYTHING RUNS FINE. THE ONLY REASON FOR THIS IS I AM USING A TO_STRING ON AN INTEGER. ENJOY.
